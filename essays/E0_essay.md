I am not a computer person, but more of a science person. Why I say that is because I'm not good at computer stuffs. No matter in programming, or coding, even games,I don't really like playing games actually.However, I believe people can change, so I tried playing it, I find out that I really don't like playing computer games but I can accept it, and I believe I will like it one day, because I am changing my feelings and it's just slightly different.
I am a person who like to challenge themselves. I decided to come abroad to study and live by myself far away from family, was me challenging myself. And I trust my decision and it turned out to be a wise decision. On the path of my major exploring, I wasn't sure what I should chose, and by the chance of being a ATA,(assistance of teaching assistance) of ICS 101, I realized I can challenege myself again!But I didn't have that much a confidence of majoring in IT, and I do like business, so I chosed a major which is related to information technology but also related to business. And I believe I can change and challenge myself more.

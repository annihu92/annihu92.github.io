**Invoice1**
I feel like this WOD is a bit difficult for me, it is totally a different thing comparing to the BrowserHistory. And I think it's different concept as well. Because we are starting to use Javascript Operater.
I realize that using inspect of the webpage is very useful!Because when I was about to finish, I tried loadiing the invoice from localhost, and it's incomplete, I used inspect to check my errors, and fixed it.
What made me feel hard, or what really slowed me down was that I made mistakes in thr front so that I had to often check back and forth to make sure it's right. And changing the numbers of eachi items and names mutually is a thing that took long time for me.
I did read and do it by myself at the first attempt, it took me like 40min, and I went watch the video, I realized that there's some shortcuts and a few ways to make it easier.
I can prepare more before doing the WODs.
**Summary**
I think it is important to watch the video, it not just can help you out a lot of time, but also can teach you some shortcuts to make it easier.

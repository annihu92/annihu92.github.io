<h2>Browser History 1:<h2>

	In the first WOD assignment Browser History 1, I did not know what we should do, the task instruction was clear, but I didn’t understand what we should do and what is this assignment’s main purpose. Thus, I first watched the screencast, and I thought we should prepare the same apps to operate. And after asking the professor, I knew we don’t need to have it, it was just a same app as VS Code to operate the process. After reading the instruction and watched the video, I realized that we should be operating it by ourselves, without watching it and operate at the same time. So, the first attempt was very slow and confusing.
	The second time I knew what we should do, and I tried to put in the code according to the instructions. But sadly, I wasn’t quick enough, so I realized that I wasn’t familiar with my codes, and I should save the pictures first, as well as the links, prepare these first before doing the process. Thus, I began to start the third time attempt.
	After prepared the sources and materials I need, saved them where I can find, I started my third attempt. And it was very effective! And successfully, I made it in the required time limit.
	
<h2>Browser History 2&3:<h2>

	In this assignment Browser History 2&3, I had a brief idea of what we should do. So according to the skills we learned in class as well as from ICS 101. I quickly link the sources and followed the instructions, it wasn’t that bad. I wasn’t familiar with the skills and codes, so I wrote them down, to figure them out, know more about it and summary the patterns. I know we can search the codes online, but I wanted to get familiar with it so that I can operate it better.

<h2>Summary:<h2>
	
	Before operating the assignments, I had problems on screen recordings, until now, so I had to ask if I could use Zoom. And of course, the point of recording is watching our process of programming, so before I do the task I watched and learned how to use OBS to screen record, even though it didn’t help a lot, but it was a try.
